# üìä Dashboard Calculations & Data Flow Guide

## Overview

This document explains how the Member Dashboard performs its calculations, what data it's based on, and how to manage the underlying data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of a member's financial and participation status within their savings group.

---

## üéØ Dashboard Architecture

### **Data Flow:**
```
Database Tables ‚Üí Backend API (calculations) ‚Üí Frontend Components (display)
```

### **Key Endpoint:**
- **`GET /api/members/{member_id}/dashboard`** - Returns all dashboard data
- **Location:** `services/users/project/api/members.py` (lines 90-256)

---

## üìà Dashboard Cards & Calculations

### **1. Savings Progress Card** üí∞

**What it shows:**
- Total savings across all fund types
- Progress toward savings target
- Current vs. Target comparison

**Calculation Logic:**

```python
# Backend: services/users/project/api/members.py (lines 104-123)

# Step 1: Get all member_savings records for this member
member_savings = MemberSaving.query.filter_by(member_id=member_id).all()

# Step 2: For each saving type, calculate balance
for ms in member_savings:
    balance = total_deposits - total_withdrawals
    
# Step 3: Sum all balances
total_savings = sum([fund['balance'] for fund in funds])

# Step 4: Calculate progress percentage
target = member.share_balance  # From group_members table
progress_percentage = (total_savings / target * 100) if target > 0 else 0
```

**Data Sources:**
- **`member_savings`** table - Stores balances per saving type
  - `total_deposits` - Sum of all deposits
  - `total_withdrawals` - Sum of all withdrawals
  - `current_balance` - Net balance (deposits - withdrawals)
- **`group_members`** table - Stores member's target
  - `share_balance` - Used as savings target

**How to Update:**
- ‚úÖ **Record deposits** ‚Üí Increases `total_deposits` in `member_savings`
- ‚úÖ **Record withdrawals** ‚Üí Increases `total_withdrawals` in `member_savings`
- ‚úÖ **Set target** ‚Üí Update `share_balance` in `group_members`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Transaction recording endpoints NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

---

### **2. Savings by Fund Card** üìä

**What it shows:**
- Breakdown of savings by fund type (Personal, ECD, Social, etc.)
- Balance and percentage for each fund
- Visual progress bars

**Calculation Logic:**

```python
# Backend: services/users/project/api/members.py (lines 108-122)

# For each saving type the member has:
savings_by_fund_dict = {}
for ms in member_savings:
    saving_type = SavingType.query.filter_by(id=ms.saving_type_id).first()
    balance = float(ms.total_deposits or 0) - float(ms.total_withdrawals or 0)
    
    savings_by_fund_dict[saving_type.name] = {
        'name': saving_type.name,
        'description': saving_type.description,
        'total_deposits': float(ms.total_deposits or 0),
        'total_withdrawals': float(ms.total_withdrawals or 0),
        'balance': balance
    }

# Frontend calculates percentage:
percentage = (fund.balance / total_savings) * 100
```

**Data Sources:**
- **`member_savings`** table - Balance per fund type
- **`saving_types`** table - Fund metadata (name, description)
- **`group_saving_type_settings`** table - Group-specific fund rules

**How to Manage:**
- ‚úÖ **Add new fund types** ‚Üí Use "Manage Saving Types" in Group Settings
- ‚úÖ **View fund types** ‚Üí `GET /api/groups/{group_id}/saving-types`
- ‚úÖ **Delete fund types** ‚Üí `DELETE /api/groups/{group_id}/saving-types/{type_id}`

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Fund management fully implemented**

### **3. Loan Status Card** üí≥

**What it shows:**
- Loan eligibility status
- Maximum loan amount
- Overall credit score
- Risk level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Active loans count and outstanding balance

**Calculation Logic:**

```python
# Backend: services/users/project/api/members.py (lines 125-153)

# Step 1: Get latest loan assessment
loan_assessment = LoanAssessment.query.filter_by(
    member_id=member_id
).order_by(LoanAssessment.assessment_date.desc()).first()

# Step 2: Get active loans
active_loans = db.session.execute(text("""
    SELECT principal, outstanding_balance
    FROM group_loans
    WHERE member_id = :member_id
    AND status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'DISBURSED', 'REPAYING')
"""), {'member_id': member_id}).fetchall()

# Step 3: Calculate totals
total_loan_amount = sum([loan.principal for loan in active_loans])
total_outstanding = sum([loan.outstanding_balance for loan in active_loans])

# Step 4: Return loan status
loan_status = {
    'is_eligible': loan_assessment.is_eligible,
    'max_loan_amount': loan_assessment.max_loan_amount,
    'overall_score': loan_assessment.overall_score,
    'risk_level': loan_assessment.risk_level,
    'active_loans_count': len(active_loans),
    'total_loan_amount': total_loan_amount,
    'total_outstanding': total_outstanding
}
```

**Data Sources:**
- **`loan_assessments`** table - Eligibility and scoring
  - `total_savings` - Member's total savings at assessment
  - `attendance_rate` - Attendance % at assessment
  - `months_active` - How long member has been active
  - `savings_score` - Score based on savings (0-100)
  - `attendance_score` - Score based on attendance (0-100)
  - `participation_score` - Score based on participation (0-100)
  - `overall_score` - Weighted average of all scores
  - `is_eligible` - Boolean eligibility flag
  - `max_loan_amount` - Maximum loan they can take
  - `risk_level` - LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
- **`group_loans`** table - Active loan records
  - `principal` - Original loan amount
  - `outstanding_balance` - Amount still owed
  - `status` - PENDING, APPROVED, DISBURSED, REPAYING, COMPLETED, DEFAULTED

**How Loan Eligibility is Calculated:**

The loan assessment algorithm (not yet implemented in API) should calculate:

```python
# Pseudo-code for loan assessment calculation:

# 1. Savings Score (40% weight)
savings_score = min(100, (total_savings / (share_value * 12)) * 100)

# 2. Attendance Score (30% weight)
attendance_score = attendance_rate  # Already a percentage

# 3. Participation Score (30% weight)
participation_score = (
    (participated_in_discussions * 0.4) +
    (contributed_to_savings * 0.4) +
    (voted_on_decisions * 0.2)
) * 100

# 4. Overall Score
overall_score = (
    savings_score * 0.40 +
    attendance_score * 0.30 +
    participation_score * 0.30
)

# 5. Eligibility Rules (from group_settings)
is_eligible = (
    months_active >= min_months_for_loan AND
    attendance_rate >= min_attendance_for_loan AND
    overall_score >= 60 AND
    no_outstanding_fines
)

# 6. Max Loan Amount
max_loan_amount = total_savings * max_loan_multiplier
```

### **4. Performance Comparison Card** üìä

**What it shows:**
- Member's savings vs. group average
- Member's attendance vs. group average
- Performance indicators (above/below average)

**Calculation Logic:**

```python
# Backend: services/users/project/api/members.py (lines 183-196)

# Step 1: Calculate group average savings
group_avg_savings = db.session.query(
    func.avg(GroupMember.total_contributions)
).filter(
    GroupMember.group_id == member.group_id,
    GroupMember.is_active == True
).scalar() or 0

# Step 2: Calculate group average attendance
group_avg_attendance = db.session.query(
    func.avg(GroupMember.attendance_percentage)
).filter(
    GroupMember.group_id == member.group_id,
    GroupMember.is_active == True
).scalar() or 0

# Frontend calculates differences:
savings_diff = member_savings - group_avg_savings
savings_percent_diff = ((savings_diff / group_avg_savings) * 100)
is_above_average = savings_diff >= 0
```

**Data Sources:**
- **`group_members`** table - All members in the group
  - `total_contributions` - Used for savings average
  - `attendance_percentage` - Used for attendance average
  - `is_active` - Only active members included in averages

**How to Update:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic** - Recalculated on every dashboard load
- Updates when member savings or attendance changes

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Fully functional**

### **5. Financial Metrics Card** üíµ

**What it shows:**
- Attendance rate and status (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Total meetings and attended meetings
- Fines status (total, paid, outstanding)

**Calculation Logic:**

```python
# Backend: services/users/project/api/members.py (lines 155-181)

# ATTENDANCE CALCULATION
total_meetings = db.session.query(func.count(MeetingAttendance.id)).filter(
    MeetingAttendance.member_id == member_id
).scalar() or 0

attended_meetings = db.session.query(func.count(MeetingAttendance.id)).filter(
    MeetingAttendance.member_id == member_id,
    MeetingAttendance.is_present == True
).scalar() or 0

attendance_rate = (attended_meetings / total_meetings * 100) if total_meetings > 0 else 0

# FINES CALCULATION
total_fines = db.session.query(
    func.coalesce(func.sum(MemberFine.amount), 0)
).filter(
    MemberFine.member_id == member_id
).scalar() or 0

paid_fines = db.session.query(
    func.coalesce(func.sum(MemberFine.paid_amount), 0)
).filter(
    MemberFine.member_id == member_id,
    MemberFine.is_paid == True
).scalar() or 0

outstanding_fines = total_fines - paid_fines
```

**Data Sources:**
- **`meeting_attendance`** table - Attendance records
